% Generate wind field

% This part will be released after the paper is acccepted


%% Generate Mooring Matrix (in different water depthï¼Œmooring length and archor radius)
% This part will be released after the paper is acccepted



%% Communication Failures 
% Communication failures will block the command from onshore centralized controllers
% We don't involve a centralized controller in this example. So the local
% controller is adopted.
